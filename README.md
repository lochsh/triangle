## Instructions for creating development environment:

* Create a virtual environment with a Python 3.5+ interpreter
* Install requirements using `pip`

E.g.:

* `$ virtualenv venv -ppython3.5`
* `$ source ./venv/bin/activate` in bash or `$ activate` in fish
* `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

## To run tests:
* `$ py.test triangle_test.py`

The previously run hypothesis tests are in .hypothesis/examples
